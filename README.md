# cassetteWinder

## About

This is a utility for my hobby of recording cassettes. Counting the minutes and seconds of songs with a reasonable margin of error as to not make it overrun the length of a cassette is strenuous and irritating. This script simply does the counting quickly, easily, and creates an easy to read tracklist so you can easily fast-forward to whatever song you want.

## Usage

Simply run main.py. On linux, this program will need superuser permissions in order to create files. The loop will run you through the whole process. A spotify account will be needed. Log in at https://developer.spotify.com and create a new application. Thus, write your client ID, client secret and callback id (which ideally is http://localhost:8080/callback) in credentials.py.
